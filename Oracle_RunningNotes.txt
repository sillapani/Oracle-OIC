Data Stitch and Global Variables

List files
	process a list of files available on ftp folder
		list of orders
	generating one separate json file for each order processed
	
Process list of files - generate one single file for each csv


Global variables
	supports complex types
	retain the values/data generated in the inner scopes to outer scopes

Data stitch
	assining values to variables
	appending an element to a list(collection)
	deleting an element from a list(collection)
	Usually we go for data stitch only when map is not possible
	
Assign
	supports only string type
	
Map
	assign values to variables
	target object is fixed - has to be based on an invoke
		can't use Map to assign values to a global variable

Practice (assignment)

	process all the csv files - multiple orders
	generate one xml for each csv files
	zip xml files

Orchestration
	Logger, Note, Notification, Wait
	Create schedules on scheduled orchestration
	
publish/subscribe
	
Logger
	this for custom logging into the trace file
Note
	adding a comment
	does not have any impact on the execution

Notification	
	used for sending email notifications
	
	
Synchronous
	input
	output
client of a synschronous service
	will wait until receives the response before going to next step

Asynchronous -> One way
	input
	no output
client of a asynschronous service
	will not wait for the response, it will trigger and continue to next step without waiting for the response

Practices (file, db)
---------------------
1. Update the poprocessing to write processed order to a on-prem file
2. Create integration
	for reading the order file from on-prem file
	process order

3. On-prem folder has a list of files (orders) -> Assignment
	Process each of them in single request
	with the help of List files
	

4. On-prem folder has a list of files (orders)
   Process each of them in single request
   File Adapter
		Poll read
		
5. Read employee details from on-prem database

6. Create a new employee in on-prem employees table (assignment)

7. Create one function in db
	can take department_id as input
	return number of employees as response.
  execute that function from oic
  
8. Execute one function which can take department_id as input and return department_details as reponse - assignment
		

Setup
jdk 1.8 only not below or above
oracle db xe 
should be able to run the agent
	download the agent
	configure
	start the agent

Practices
1. Read suppliers from onprem db and create suppliers in fusion. Update db back with Success status
2. Read suppliers from onprem db and create suppliers in fusion. 
Update db back with Success/Error based on supplier creation status

FTP:
1.  csv file. Read all records from csv, create suppliers in fusion. 
	if any error record is there, it will quit automatically from that record.

2. 	csv file. Read all records from csv, create suppliers in fusion. 
	Handle faults
	in error case, just log a msg
	
3. csv file. Read all records from csv, create suppliers in fusion. 
	Handle faults
	create one file for success records, write it to ftp
	create one file for error records, write it to ftp

If the fault is not supressed, it will go to next level
If the fault is suppressed compeltely, final status of integration will be Success
Global fault will be executed only when the fault is not completely supressed in the integration
Global fault, has access to fault object. If you want to use any object from the integration you have to use global variable

Practices
--------------
1. Build integration (wrapper get all suppliers rest service) for getting all the suppliers, 
return the response in a trimmed json structure.

2. Retrieving the suppliers from fusion and write them as XML on ftp (assignment)

3. Enhance the first integration to accept a q parameter (assignment)
	retrieve the suppliers where TaxOrganizationType != Corporation


Build integration (wrapper get one suppliers rest service) for getting one supplier base on the supplierid, 
return the response in a trimmed json structure.
